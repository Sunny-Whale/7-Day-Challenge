#  :muscle: 7 Day Challenge Supplement 
<br>

> A mood companion system  

## Overview
This yearâ€™s Student Council Mental Awareness Day initiative goes beyond a 45 min session and embarks on building a habit for life. With the spirit of mental well being, Iâ€™m proud to announce the launch of our very own mood companion system [Sunny Whale Reflect](https://reflect.sunnywhale.in). The app ties in with our idea of taking meaningful action post the session.

As part of the 7 Day challenge, students are to add [reflections and moments](#reflections-and-moments) daily for a week after which a [Mood Scape](#mood-scape) is generated along with graphical analysis of past moods. Through this, our student community has a fixed and shareable outcome and takeaway from the session.

The app is now live at https://reflect.sunnywhale.in. (*Both desktop and mobile devices are supported*)

Feel free to reach out to me at any time for questions or suggestions.

Below are further details and approaches to introduce the app to your respective classrooms.
